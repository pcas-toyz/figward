# figward
A work-in-progress simple GUI program for figure drawing practice written in python with guietta. Allows for an unlimited amount of locally stored reference image folders/libraries to do timed figure drawing sessions on whatever you wish to practice. Contains simple timers, class timers, and hopefully custom timers in the future.
